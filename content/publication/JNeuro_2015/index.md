abstract: The fidelity with which cortical sensory areas represent environmental stimuli poses a strong constraint on the quality, suitability, and precision of any subsequent computation and, ultimately, on the organism's behavioral performance. To shed some light into the origins of trial-to-trial variability in population responses and its relation to ongoing cortical states, this journal club article reviews the work of Scholvinck et al. (2015).
