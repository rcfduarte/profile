I am a research scientist and lecturer in the domain of cognitive, neuro-inspired AI. I have always been fascinated by the brain and how its complex electrochemical circuitry gives rise to cognition and behavior. Providing a meaningful contribution to our understanding of _how the brain computes the mind_ is thus one of my most ambitious life goals and a pursuit I feel very passionate about. My research aims to unravel fundamental computational principles and mechanisms of neural information processing (with a particular emphasis on the mammalian neocortex) and to exploit them to develop adaptive intelligent systems. I am particularly interested in sequential rule learning and the acquisition and representation of temporal structure across different scales in modular, hierarchical systems.
