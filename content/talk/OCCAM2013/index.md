abstract: "Higher cognitive functioning is assumed to be largely representational and compositional in nature. At various processing stages, from perceptual to motor, discrete structural elements with
intricate temporal dependencies are combined into increasingly complex constructs. In order to
address these issues and to attempt to map these complex processes to the underlying neuronal
infrastructure, we adopt ideas and formalisms developed by theoretical linguistics to study the
nature of rule-like or compositional behavior. The Artificial Grammar Learning (AGL) paradigm
has a long tradition as a means to study the nature of syntactic processing and implicit sequence
learning. With mere exposure and without performance feedback, human beings implicitly acquire
knowledge about the structural regularities implemented by complex rule systems.
In this work, we investigate to which extent generic cortical microcircuits can support
formally explicit symbolic computations, instantiated by formal grammars and implementing
various types of local and non-adjacent dependencies between the sequence elements, thus
requiring varying degrees of computational complexity and online processing memory to be
adequately learned. We use concrete implementations of input-driven recurrent networks composed
of noisy, spiking neurons, built according to the reservoir computing framework and dynamically
shaped by a variety of synaptic and intrinsic plasticity mechanisms operating concomitantly. We
show that, when shaped by plasticity, these models are capable of acquiring the structure of simple
(regular) grammars. Additionally, when asked to judge string legality (in a manner similar to human
subjects), the networks perform at a qualitatively comparable level."
