abstract: "Several organizational principles of the neocortex appear to imply a strong predisposition to acquire temporal structure in a completely incidental/unsupervised manner, a process that is central to many core aspects of cognition. In this work, we explore the processes involved in implicit, structured sequence learning in biologically-inspired architectures, systems where the current state continuously interacts with and modifies the processing characteristics. We demonstrate a prominent role of synaptic plasticity (particularly of inhibitory
synapses) in representational and rule-guided learning, an effect achieved by maintaining compact dynamic representations and sparse, distributed activity patterns. We highlight a form of sequential metastability as a potential mechanism for sequence processing in neocortical circuits. In addition, I will discuss how innate constraints in the patterning of the synaptic machinery throughout the neocortex may bias a circuit’s intrinsic timescales and memory
capacity, while the high degree of complexity and heterogeneity may serve important computational purposes by expanding the circuit’s functional space."
