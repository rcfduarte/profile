abstract: "Artificial Grammar Learning (AGL) paradigms study the nature of syntactic processing and implicit sequence learning. Humans acquire complex structural dependencies by mere exposure. We investigate to which extent generic cortical circuits (excitable reservoirs of spiking neurons) can support formally explicit symbolic computations and provide qualitative comparisons with Human behavioral performance."
